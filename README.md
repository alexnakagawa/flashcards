# Command Line Flashcards
---

This repository contains the source code and logic for a "Flashcards"-like script you can run inside of your own command line. 

This was a project I completed as part of the [JetBrains Academy](https://www.jetbrains.com/academy/) 30-Day Coding Challenge. I had heard the benefits of Kotlin for so long that I wanted to try it out for myself. I've left the course with a really strong understanding of the ergonomics of the language and how it makes up for a lot of the short-comings that Java has. If you're interested in the types of things I learned along the way, look under `notes.md`
